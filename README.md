# Mentaliseren_Server
Unity 2020 project of the Mentaliseren project. This is the server section

This is the complete Unity 2020.3.37 version of the Mentaliseren Server component as made by the Tech Labs of the Network Institute.
The server component is meant to be used together with the Meta Quest 2 Mentaliseren Client application (https://github.com/networkinstitutevu/Mentaliseren_Client).
This server runs on a Windows computer with a basic Internet connection (http requests over port 80). This compnent is meant to be used by the teacher to control the reactions of the avatar while a participant, wearing the Quest 2, talks out-loud.
This version uses a dedicated web service and needs to be changed to any other http service to be useful.
The PHP code is available in the PHP Code folder

Use this software -as is-.
